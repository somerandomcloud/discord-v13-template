### README

After, delete `README.md` and rename `README.EXAMPLE.md` to `README.md`, and wherever it says `BOTNAME`, rename to what you want to call your bot.
Add your GitHub to the Authors section, and change the License in the License to whatever license you are using.

I would recommend to keep everying in the Acknowledgements section, but its your README.

### Configs

Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`, and add in all needed info. Thats pretty much it. Enjoy making your bot
